# Dwarfchitect
Although there are other tools for quickly designating large pieces of land (or dirt, rock and ice...), 
some even used to quickly designate placement of stuff like furniture, I have found that there is no easy or 
elegant way to design those designations. 

My main goal is to make a single program that both allows you to very easily draw your designation and turn it
into a macro for the dwarf fortress to run. Firstly, it's probably going to be self contained, and then I might 
add support for loading or saving your projects as .csv files. Also, I'll probably stick around for terraforming 
designations like dig or channel.
